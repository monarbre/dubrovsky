# Subtitles (Weights)

This directory stores trained model weights:

- `dubrovsky.bin` - Binary weights for C/Python inference
- `dubrovsky_config.json` - Model configuration
- `tokenizer.json` - Tokenizer vocabulary

These files are generated by training (`train.py`) and export (`export_weights.py`).

The weights are not included in git (too large). Train locally or on Lambda GPU.
