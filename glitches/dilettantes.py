"""
🎭 DILETTANTES — Resonant "Expert" Routing for Dubrovsky 🎭

MOE-style (Mixture of Experts) temperature and behavior routing.
Inspired by Haze's experts.py but async and more cynical.

Unlike Haze's balanced approach, Dubrovsky's "experts" are all dilettantes —
amateurs pretending to know what they're doing. Just like Dubrovsky himself.

"I have multiple personalities. They're all dilettantes. 
 But at least they agree you're asking the wrong question."
- Alexey Dubrovsky

Features:
- Async computation (because even routing deserves async discipline)
- 6 Dubrovsky-specific experts (not 4 like Haze)
- Weights based on entropy, arousal, novelty, trauma, and mockery level
- Context momentum to avoid personality whiplash
- Integration with MathBrain and Pulse
